 
## DataJoint Interview Coding Challenge

My strategy is being developed in the jupyter notebook file here titled `Develop_pipeline.ipynb`. The pickle file needs to be in the working directory in order for this to run.

### UPDATE 04/13/2022:
I have better understood how the STRF is computed using the STA with various delays. I believe I have completed part 2 of the challenge. However, the finalized code for nicely visualizing the STRF is still pending.

To do:
* complete STRF visualizations
* package as pip installable python module
